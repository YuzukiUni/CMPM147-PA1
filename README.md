Title: Uni's Wonderland--In Magic Shop
Description: I make a simple diolouge by using the random text generator, and create the new grammar templete to complete it.
Instead of simple text, I create the dialoughe between Uni (Seller), and adventurer (Random name), because I think it is interesting.

Statement: I am trying to achieve is a text generator that can include most of situation happened in Uni's Magic Shop.
According to my draft, the adventurer can :
1. Purchase the potions.
2. The Adventurer can receive the latest news happened in different place. (Also, the Uni's Magic shop can open in elsewhere)
3. The Uni's magic shop can become secrect adventurer's guild, which provide the private task to any adventurer.
From now, I think I achieve my desired effect for 1 and 2. For 3, this will be more complicated in randomly generating task names and getting paid. Therefore, the reward obtained by each task is fixed. Even if the task is randomly generated, the reward received by the same task is not allowed to be random. For example, the task reward of task A can only be A, and other randomly generated numbers are not allowed.
Currently, I can't do this based on the sample code right now.
